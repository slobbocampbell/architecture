    documentation="A service mesh makes it easy to create a network of deployed services with load balancing, service-to-service authentication, monitoring, and more, with few or no code changes in service code. You add service mesh support to services by deploying a special sidecar proxy throughout your environment that intercepts all network communication between microservices, then configure and manage Istio using its control plane functionality, which includes:&#xA;&#xA;Automatic load balancing for HTTP, gRPC, WebSocket, and TCP traffic.&#xA;&#xA;Fine-grained control of traffic behavior with rich routing rules, retries, failovers, and fault injection.&#xA;&#xA;A pluggable policy layer and configuration API supporting access controls, rate limits and quotas.&#xA;&#xA;Automatic metrics, logs, and traces for all traffic within a cluster, including cluster ingress and egress.&#xA;&#xA;Secure service-to-service communication in a cluster with strong identity-based authentication and authorization.&#xA;&#xA;Istio is an example of a Service Mesh - https://istio.io/docs/concepts/what-is-istio/"/>
